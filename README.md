# hactober-fest-2019-
Open source is changing the world – one pull request at a time.
Contributing If you want to contribute to a project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.





Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!!

● Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.

● You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register and then make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as invalid or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will earn a T-shirt. (Last year atleast 46,088 people earned a shirt!)
